Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.
