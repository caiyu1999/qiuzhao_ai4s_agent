Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH

# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

```

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

2025-07-29 16:25:59 [INFO] openevolve_graph.Graph.Graph_Node:75 - [INFO] 2025-07-29 16:25:59 | GraphNode | Prompt construction completed | island_id=3 | prompt_length=16113 | evolution_round=4 | diff_based_evolution=ture | prompt=You are an expert mathematician specializing in circle packing problems and computational geometry. Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.

Your task is to improve a constructor function that directly produces a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square, maximizing the sum of their radii. The AlphaEvolve paper achieved a sum of 2.635 for n=26.

Key geometric insights:
- Circle packings often follow hexagonal patterns in the densest regions
- Maximum density for infinite circle packing is pi/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.9069
- Edge effects make square container packing harder than infinite packing
- Circles can be placed in layers or shells when confined to a square
- Similar radius circles often form regular patterns, while varied radii allow better space utilization
- Perfect symmetry may not yield the optimal packing due to edge effects

Focus on designing an explicit constructor that places each circle in a specific position, rather than an iterative search algorithm.

# Task
Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example of valid diff format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(p):
        for k in range(n):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
=======
# Reorder loops for better memory access pattern
for i in range(m):
    for k in range(n):
        for j in range(p):
            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You can suggest multiple changes. Each SEARCH section must exactly match code in the current program.
Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire program - focus on targeted improvements.
